dashing-pingdom-uptime
======================

Dashing (http://shopify.github.io/dashing/) widget to display Pingdom Uptime of selected check

I'm sorry if the code is not very well, but I had never made ruby and I'm not a developer, so be indulgent with me

##Dependencies

[rest-client](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rest-client/1.6.7/frames)

Add it to dashing's gemfile:

    gem 'rest-client'
    
and run `bundle install`. Everything should work now :)

How to use it
=============

Put this file pingdomuptime.rb on jobs folder

Put the directory pingdomuptime on widgets folder

Personnalize pingdomuptime.rb file and enjoy !!!

##Settings

Modify the file pingdomuptime.rb and adapt this value :

    api_key = ENV['PINGDOM_API_KEY'] || ''
    user = ENV['PINGDOM_USER'] || ''
    password = ENV['PINGDOM_PASSWORD'] || ''


You can choose to filter what you want to monitor, it's based to check name (If you put nothing, you will get all checks)

    checkName = "toto"
